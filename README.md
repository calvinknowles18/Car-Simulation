# Java Car Project

A Java application demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming principles through a simple car modeling system. The project uses an interface, an abstract base class, and multiple subclasses to showcase inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and method overriding.

# Features

Car interface defining required behaviors

Abstract base class containing shared attributes and methods

Concrete classes representing different car types

Polymorphic behavior demonstrated through a main driver program

Clean, extensible OOP design suitable for learning and expansion

# Concepts Demonstrated

- Interfaces vs. abstract classes

- Inheritance and code reuse

- Method overriding and dynamic dispatch

- Encapsulation and clean class hierarchy design

# How to Run

Compile and run the project from the command line or your preferred IDE:
- javac *.java
- java Main

# Purpose

This project was built as part of an OOP learning module and serves as a clear example of how class hierarchies and polymorphism function in Java. It can be easily expanded with additional car types, behaviors, or features.
